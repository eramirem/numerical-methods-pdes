Above we used what looked like forward Euler and leapfrog but you can use higher-order, explicit methods such as Runge-Kutta methods or an implicit method.  Implicit methods can be useful if you are not as concerned about accuracy but want to evolve the solution to large times.  Also, although the advection equation itself is not stiff, some hyperbolic PDEs can be or the spatial discretization can as well (as is the case with the spectral approach above)."
